This branch enables rules for individual unique/set item names.  [(click to **return** to the main branch)](https://github.com/BetweenWalls/Journey#Journey)

## Overview
This filter provides sane default settings in a classic style, and includes many customization options.

Most items are shown at level 1; the filter gradually becomes more strict as your character levels up to 90+. The filter file includes descriptions for what is hidden at which levels, and other descriptions are included throughout to assist with tailoring the filter to your needs.

## Features
* mostly follows classic style (it still looks like D2)
* non-equipment more clearly distinguished from equipment (gems, jewels, charms)
* unique/set/other items highlighted based on their usefulness
* regular items displayed with amount of skills and highest skill value
* dynamic display for high-price sellable items (more prices are shown the poorer you are)
* popular crafting ingredients marked with codified recipes
* natural sockets shown for unidentified unique/set items
* enhanced damage/defense shown for superior items
* identified relics show their tier
* shopping for valuable items from merchants made easier
* individual names for unidentified unique/set items (enabled in this branch)

### Examples of optional features:
* all individual skills shown
* all crafting ingredients with more descriptive recipes
* item quality (normal, exceptional, elite) for uniques/rares
* quantity for keys/tomes
* extra highlighting for unique/set items changed in Path of Diablo
